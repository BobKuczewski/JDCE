THE RESISTOR

  The resistor, as its name implies, resists the flow of electrons,
thereby limiting the amount of current that can pass through them.  The
primary use of resisters is to either reduce current, or reduce
voltage.  The amount of resistance is measured in ohms.  The greater
the value of ohms the greater the resistance to the flow of
electricity.  A resister works by converting electrical energy into
heat, therefore resisters are also measured in watts.  The Watts value
is the amount of energy that can be converted before damage to the
device occurs.  It is not wise to put more power through a resister
than its rated value or the resister may explode.  The schematic
diagram for the resister is shown in Figure 1.  Two resisters placed
in series will have the summed value of the two resisters, while two
resisters placed in parallel will have the resistance computed by the
formula shown in figure 2:

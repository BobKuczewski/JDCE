THE INDUCTOR
  
   When electricity flows through a wire an electro-magnetic field is
created around the wire.  In normal wiring this field is rather weak.
By coiling a lot of wire in a small space the effect of the
electro-magnetic field can be strengthened.  Like the capacitor, an
inductor can store energy.  Energy is stored in a coil by the EM field.
 Unlike the capacitor which stops current flow, the coil allows the
current to flow through it.  As electricity flows into the coil an EM
field develops.  The more electricity sent through the coil the more
the EM field builds.  As the EM field builds the coil will start to
develop resistance.  Eventually there will be so much resistance that
no more current will flow.  When the input current is discontinued the
magnetic field will collapse which will then induce voltage onto the
wire in the coil and electricity will then flow out of the coil.
Unlike the capacitor when the input voltage is removed, the stored
energy is released regardless if there is or is not a circuit between
the poles of the coil.  The storage capability of a coil is measured in
henries.  The principle use of coils is to alter the amount of voltage
or current in a circuit.  In most coils the voltage that flows out
during the collapse of the magnetic field actually produces more
voltage than what was used to charge the device.  The coil of a car
works this way.  The coil is charged with 12 volts and then when the
voltage is removed a current of several thousand volts is released to
the spark plugs.   A transformer is an inductor that contains two coils
of wire called the primary and secondary windings.  The primary winding
is used to build the EM field.  Then when the voltage is removed from
the primary winding the EM field collapses and induces voltage onto
both windings.  The voltage that flows out the secondary winding can be
computed by the ratio of turns in the primary winding divided by the
number of turns in the secondary winding.

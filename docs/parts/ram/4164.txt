This device is a 64k x 1 bit dynamic memory.

/RAS - Row address select (low order byte)
/CAS - Column address select (high order byte)
D    - Data input
Q    - Data output
/WE  - Write

Dynamic memories require periodic refreshing.  This device refreshes
an entire column when /CAS is pulled low.  For the purposes of this
simulation, a cell will hold its contents for 10,000 cycles without
being refreshed.

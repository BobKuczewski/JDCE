This experimental device contains an 8-bit register oriented central processing
unit. It currently only generates XTAL, TPA, TPB, and SC0. No instructions are
supported at this time.

/CLEAR  - CPU mode input.
CLK     - Clock input.
DBx     - Data bus.
/DMAIN  - DMA input request.
/DMAOUT - DMA output request.
EF1-EF4 - External flag inputs.
/INT    - Interrupt input.
MAx     - Memory Address Bus.
/MRD    - Memory Read Signal.
/MWR    - Memory Write Signal.
N0-N2   - I/O Port address lines.
Q       - Output from Q flip-flop.
SC1,SC0 - State code outputs.
TPA     - Timing pulse A.  Occurs between falling edges of cycles 1 and 2.
TPB     - Timing pulse B.  Occurs between rising edges of cycles 7 and 0.
/WAIT   - CPU mode input.

State Codes:

S0 Fetch    L      L
S1 Exec     L      H
S2 DMA      H      L
S3 INT      H      H

CPU Modes:

Special Registers:
Register       Purpose
R(0)           DMA in or out
R(1)           Interrupt vector
R(2)           X register during interrupt

Registers:
D   8-bits     Data Register
DF  1-bit      Data Flag (Carry)
R   16-bits    16 Scratchpad Registers
P   4-bits     Specifies which R register is program counter
X   4-bits     Specifies which R register is data pointer
N   4-bits     Low order nybble of instruction
T   8-bits     Holds X and P during interrupt. X is high nybble
IE  1-bit      Interrupt Enable
Q   1-bit      Output flip-flop

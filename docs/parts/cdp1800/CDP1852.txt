This device contains an 8-bit input/output port.  The device acts
as an input port when MODE=0 or as an output port when MODE=1
  
In Input mode, the data is strobed into the register while CLOCK is
high and latched when CLOCK goes low.  When CLOCK goes low, the /SR
will go low to indicate the presence of a data byte.  CS1 and CS2
must be high to enable the output register to be read.  when the
chip is deselected, the SR output will return high.
  
In the output mode the outputs are always enabled.  Data is latched
into the register when CS1 is low and CS2 and CLOCK are high.  When
either CS1 goes high or CS2 goes low the SR output will be set high,
on the next high to low transition of clock, SR will return low.

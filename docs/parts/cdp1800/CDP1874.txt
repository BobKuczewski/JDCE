This device consists of an 8-bit gated input port.  Data is read from
the input source on the rising edge of CLOCK and latched to the outputs
on the falling edge.  /CLR can be used to clear the contents of the
latch while the clock input is not active.  The chip selects control
the tri-state outputs.

This device consists of a 4-input hexadecimal to 7-Segment
display decoder.  This device incorporates both a lamp test
and zero blanking capability.
 
The Data inputs (DD,DC,DB,DA) specify in binary the numeral to
be displayed.  Numerals are provided for 0-9 as well as the
letters A thru F.
 
The output segments are defined as follows:
 
       A
     +---+
   F | G | B
     +---+
   E | D | C
     +---+
 
Notes: 1. The blanking input (/BI) must be high for display
          output.  The ripple-blanking-input (/RBI) must be
          high if blanking of a decimal zero is not desired
 
       2. When the blanking input (/BI) is held low, the display
          is blanked regardless of any other input.
 
       3. When the ripple-blanking-input (/RBI) and the data
          inputs (DD,DC,DB,DA) are low, the display will be
          blanked and ripple-blanking-output (/RBO) goes low.

       4. Data is entered into the output latches when /LE is held
          low.  When /LE is high the latched values will continue
          to be displayed regardless of the input data.

This device contains a 32K x 8 bit serial eeprom.  

A0,A1,A2  - Chip select inputs
            These input must match the A0, A1, and A2 in the status
            byte for the chip to be active
DATA      - Data is read or written on this pin
CLK       - Control clock for reading and writing data
WP        - The chip is in write protected mode when this is high

All transfers to or from the chip operate on bytes of 8 bits, and use
9 clocks to transfer the byte.  The first 8 clocks are used by the
sender to deliver the data, the 9th clock is used by the receiver to 
acknowledge the transfer.

Data is considered valid when it remains stable during a high on the
CLK input.  A change of level during a CLK high indicates two special
situations.  A high-to-low transition indicates a operation start, after
this the eeprom will expect to receive the status byte.  A low-to-high
transition indicates a stop of the current operation.

Status Byte:
  7   6   5   4   3   2   1   0
  1   0   1   0   A2  A1  A0  RW
  The status byte is always sent to the chip prior to read or write
operation.  The RW bit is low to indicate an upcoming write operation
and high to indicate an upcoming read operation.

Acknowledge:
  An ack is required by the sender after each byte of data transfered.
A low level during the 9th clock indicates positive acknowledgement.
A high level indicates an error, or end of data while in read mode.
During data writes to the eeprom, the eeprom will provide the ack
signal and therefore the data line must be released, when in read from
eeprom mode, the receiving device must signal the ack during the 9th 
clock.

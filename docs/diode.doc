THE DIODE

  In a conductor electricity can flow in both directions.  A device
that allows electricity to flow in only one direction is called a
semi-conductor.  The diode is the most basic semiconductor.  The
schematic diagram for the diode is shown in figure 1.  The vertical
line represents the cathode (or negative) pole of the diode.

  The diode is made from two different substances, called P-material
and N-material (see figure 2).  Most diodes use silicon as the base
material for making the P and N materials.  In P material the silicon
is impregnated with impurities that give the resultant material an
abundance of holes, or positively charged material.  In N material the
silicon is impregnated with impurities that give the resultant material
an abundance of electrons, thereby making the material negatively
charged.  The barrier between the P and N materials requires a certain
amount of voltage for an electron to jump it (thereby preventing the
mutual attraction of the positive and negative charges).  This
threshold level is referred to as the standing hill battery.  Under
normal operating conditions the negative pole of your circuit is
connected to the negative pole (or cathode) of the diode, while the
positive pole of your circuit is connected to the positive pole (or
anode) of the diode.

  Lets first look at what happens when voltage is applied in the
reverse direction.  Figure 3 shows what happens.  Notice in the
P-material the positive charges were attracted to the negative charge
being applied, and in the N-material the negative charges are attracted
to the positive charge being applied.  This results in a zone of
non-conductive material near the barrier.  If enough voltage is applied
you can actually force electrons across, but this will permanently
damage the device.  The voltage at which this break-down occurs is
called the Peak Inverse Voltage or PIV.  You should never exceed the
PIV when voltages on the diode are reversed.

               Figure 3

  Now lets look at what happens when the voltage is applied in the
forward direction.  Notice in Figure 4 that the positive charge being
applied to the anode repels the positive charges, forcing them to the
barrier, and in the N-material the negative charge repels the negative
charges and forces them towards the barrier.

           +-----------+-----------+
               Figure 4

As the voltage is continually applied the P-material fills up with holes
and the N-material fills up with electrons (see Figure 5).  When both
sides are full, then if enough voltage is applied (the threshold voltage)
then an electron will jump the barrier and continue on through the P
material and out the anode.  At this point electrons can flow across
the barrier so long as the applied voltage remains above the threshold
level.

THE CAPACITOR

  The capacitor is a form of storage device.  A capacitor is made from
two plates separated by an insulator called a dielectric.  The
schematic diagram for the capacitor is shown in Figure 1.  The amount

of capacitance is measured in farads.  When electricity is fed into the
two plates an abundance of electrons accumulates on the negative plate
and a lack of electrons accumulates on the positive plate.  The
dielectric between the plates is thin enough that mutual attraction
between the positive and negative plates can occur.  This loosely holds
the electrons on the negative plate (see Figure 2-3).  If the
dielectric is "leaky" then electrons from the negative plate can cross
to the positive plate and nullify the effect of the capacitor.  Over a
given time period the capacitor will charge 66% of its full charge,
over the next time period 66% of what remains will be charged and so
forth.  The time period is determined by the voltage and amperage used
to charge the capacitor.  When power is removed and no circuit exists
between the negative and positive plates, the electrons will continue
to be stored.  When a circuit is provided between the plates the
electrons will then flow through the circuit to equalize the pressure
lacking in the positive plate.  Like the charging cycle, the discharge
cycle also releases only 66% of the remaining charge.  Two capacitors
wired in parallel will have the sum of the individual capacitance while
capacitors wired in series will have the total capacitance as computed
by this formula:

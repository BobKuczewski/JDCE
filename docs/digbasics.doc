BASICS

  All of the devices talked about above are called "Analog" devices.
This is because there function is based upon varying voltage or current
levels.  For instance, the resister lowered the amount of current, or
the coil allowed us to create more voltage than was applied to it.  In
digital electronics we work in only two voltage levels, termed High and
Low.  The High value equates to the voltage source of the power supply.
 In the case of the 7400 series parts the voltage used is 5 volts,
therefore a "High" signal is equivalent to 5 volts.  The "Low" signal
equates to ground (or the negative pole of the power source), and
represents no current flow, or zero volts.

  There is also a third state called High-Z.  This state represents an
unconnected pin, or not at 5v but also not at 0v.  Normally multiple
outputs from parts cannot be tied together or damage to the device will
occur.  Parts that have tri-state outputs allow you to connect multiple
outputs together without harm to the devices so long as only one device
is actually enabled.  In the 7400 series parts that we will be using,
an unconnected (or High Z) input is considered High for input purposes.
 Other series of chips may have different rules concerning High Z
inputs.

  Many circuits have clock inputs.  These inputs are used to
synchronize the operation of a circuit.  Clock pulses come in two
varieties, Active High and Active Low.  The Active High clock is at a
low level in the rest state and at a high level in the active state.
There are also two edges for each clock pulse.  In the active high
clock the low to high transition of the signal is also referred to as
the leading edge, rising edge, or positive edge of the pulse.  The high
to low transition is referred to as the trailing edge, falling edge, or
negative edge of the pulse.  The active low clock is at a high level in
the rest state and a low level in the active state.  The active low
clock also has two edges, but they are a little bit different since the
falling edge is now the leading edge and the rising edge is now the
trailing edge.

  The basic building blocks of digital circuits are made using various
combinations of resisters, transistors, and diodes.  The 7400 series
chips all belong to the TTL family of logic devices.  The TTL stands
for Transistor-Transistor Logic.  There are also many other families of
chips.  These include CMOS (Complimentary Metal Oxide Semi-conductor),
VMOS, NMOS, NChannel, DTL (Diode-Transistor Logic), and RTL
(Resister-Transistor Logic).  Each of these varying technologies have
differing characteristics.  Most TTL devices operate on 5V while most
CMOS devices can run anywhere from 3v to 15v.  CMOS devices typically
use less power than TTL, but they are also much more sensitive to
static discharge and can easily be destroyed.

  The 7400 series also has many different variations.  You can identify
which type a chip is by looking immediately after the "74".  If there
are no letters then the device is considered Standard TTL.  An example
is the 7400 NAND gate.  If there is a "S" then the device uses Schottky
diodes which improve switching times, therefore the device operates
faster.  An example is the 74S32 OR gate.  If there is a "LS" then the
device is a low-power Schottky device.  These devices consume less
power and also have the improved switching capability.  An example is
the 74LS04 Hex Inverter.  If there is a "C" then the device is actually
a CMOS equivalent of the TTL chip.  The CMOS versions use considerably
less power than the standard version.  An example is the 74C08 AND gate.

  Commonly we abbreviate the names of chips when we are talking about
chips all belonging to the same family.  Instead of saying 74244 we can
abbreviate the part number to just '244.  The apostrophe symbol (') is
to denote an abbreviation of the chip name.  This abbreviation is
normally only used when talking about chips belonging to the same
family, if chips from different families are being used at the same
time it is customary to use the full name.

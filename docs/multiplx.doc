MULTIPLEXERS/ENCODERS

  A multiplexer is a circuit that allows you select from a number of
available data sources.  Through the use of multiplexers multiple
devices can share a common bus.  Multiplexers are also referred to as
data selectors.

  Lets start our investigation of multiplexers with the 74LS151.  This
device is a 1 of 8 data selector/multiplexer, meaning that one of eight
possible inputs will routed to the output.  The circuit "74LS151.CKT"
demonstrates the use of this device.  The switches marked 'DATA' are
all fed into the inputs of the '151.  The 'SELECT' switches then select
which of the data inputs to route to the output LED.  The DATA switches
provide a high when in the up position and a low in the down position.
Notice that only the SELECTed switch will change the state of the LED.
The GATE input enables the device when the input is low.  When this
input is high the chip will output a low.

  Now lets look at the 74LS150.  This device is a 1 of 16 data
selector.  Up to 16 data sources can be connected to the inputs of this
device.  The circuit "74LS150.CKT" demonstrates the function of this
chip.  Notice that there is a very important difference between this
chip and the '151.  The '150 has an inverted output, this means that
the output of the device will be the opposite of whatever the selected
input is.  This device is also gated and when the device is not
selected a high will presented at the output.

  The 74LS153 is a dual 1 of 4 data selector.  This chip is used if you
need to route two signals from up to 4 sources.  Load the circuit
"74LS153.CKT" to see the operation of this device.  Notice the select
inputs are shared between the two halves of this multiplexer.  Separate
gates are provided for both multiplexers.

  The 74LS157 is a quad 1 of 2 data selector.  This device is primarily
used to route up to 4 signals from 2 data sources.  The circuit
"74LS157.CKT" demonstrates the operation of the '157.  Notice that when
the select switch is in the A position, the states of the DATA A
switches appear on the output LEDs and when the select switch is in the
B position the DATA B switches appear on the LEDs.  This device is also
gated and will output lows when the device is not enabled.

  All other data selectors and multiplexers in the 7400 series as well
as other families will work very similarly to the above devices.

  Now lets take a look at Encoders.  An encoder is a circuit that takes
multiple input lines and encodes the numeric value associated with the
input line into standard binary numbering which is then output from the
chip.

  The74LS147 is a 10 to 4 encoder.  With 10 possible output states this
device is referred to as a decimal encoder.  There are actually only
nine active low inputs on this device.  No active inputs is considered
the tenth state of the device.  Load the circuit "74LS147.CKT" and try
experimenting with this chip.  This device actually outputs the encoded
value as an active low number, therefore the bits are inverted from we
normally recognize as binary numbers.  For instance when you turn
switch 2 on the output is actually H H L H, which in standard binary
numbers is really 13 (or D in hex).  Therefore if you actually require
the correct binary output, the outputs must be put through inverters.
In the sample circuit the green LEDs represent the standard output from
the '147, while the red LEDs represent inverted data which will show
the correct binary number.  When changing switches take note that the
largest number input is the input that will actually be encoded.  It is
for this trait that these devices are often called priority encoders.

  The 74LS148 is a 8 to 3 encoder, and is often called an Octal
encoder.  This device acts much like the '147.  Like the '147 the '148
has both active low inputs as well as active low outputs.  In addition
there are three inputs provided that allow for expansion of the
encoder.  Circuit "74LS148.CKT" demonstrates the operation of the '148.
 Notice again that the largest active input is the one that is encoded,
also note that now there is an actual zero input, no longer is the zero
state implied.  The EI or Enable Input is used when cascading multiple
'148s.  When this input is low the chip will perform the encoding
function, if EI is high all outputs from the device will be high.  The
GS output signals when a valid encode is available on the outputs.  If
any input is active then the output will be valid and GS will be low.
If all inputs are high then the output state is considered to be
invalid and the GS output will be high.  The EO or Enable Output is the
cascading output.  If the device is enabled and there are no active
inputs then the EO will be low which could allow another encoder to be
active.  If any inputs are active and EI is low then the EO will be
high.

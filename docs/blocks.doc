BUILDING BLOCKS

  In digital electronics their are three basic building blocks which
are called gates.  All digital circuits can be made from these three
gates.  The gates are called AND, OR, and NOT.  It is essential that
you fully understand the use of these gates, for with these gate you
can build any digital circuit.

  The AND gate can be likened to a circuit with two switches in series.
 Both switches must be on for current to flow.  In an AND gate all
inputs must be logic high for the gate to output a High.  The schematic
diagram for the AND gate is shown in figure 1.  The truth table for
the AND gate is as follows:


	A   B ! Y
        ------+--                        +-------
	L   L ! L                   A ---!       \
	L   H ! L                        !        !--- Y
	H   L ! L                   B ---!       /
	H   H ! H                        +-------
                                    Figure 1

  The included circuit "AND.CKT" contains a 74LS08 Quad AND device.
Both the A and B switches are active high,  therefore the Y LED will
only light when both switches are on.

  The OR gate is like a circuit that has two switches in parallel.  If
either switch is on the current is allowed to flow.  In the OR gate if
any input is logic high then the output will be logic high.  The
schematic diagram for the OR gate is show in figure 2.  The truth
table for the OR gate is as follows:

	A   B ! Y
        ------+--                        +-------
	L   L ! L                   A ----\      \
	L   H ! H                          !      !--- Y
	H   L ! H                   B ----/      /
	H   H ! H                        +-------
                                    Figure 2


  The included circuit "OR.CKT" contains a 74LS32 Quad OR device.  Both
the A and B switches are active high,  therefore the Y LED will light
when either switch is on.

  The NOT gate, also referred to as an "Inverter", is used to change
the level of a signal.  If the input is logic high, then the output
will be logic low.  If the input is logic low, then the output will be
logic high.  The schematic diagram of the NOT gate is show in figure
3.  The truth table for the NOT gate is a follows:

                                    !\
	A ! Y                       ! \
        --+--                  A ---!  >O--- Y
	L ! H                       ! /
	H ! L                       !/
                               Figure 3

  The included circuit "INV.CKT" contains a 74LS04 Hex Inverter.  The A
switch is active high,  therefore the Y LED will only light when the
switch is off.

  There is one more gate that is commonly used That is actually a
permutation of the OR gate.  This gate is called Exclusive-OR  If both
inputs to this gate are the same, then the output will be low.  If both
inputs are different levels then the output will be high.  This device
is very useful as a comparator between two signals.  The schematic
diagram of the Exclusive-OR gate is show in figure 4.  The truth
table for the Exclusive-OR gate is shown below:

	A   B ! Y
        ------+--                        \ +-------
	L   L ! L                   A ----\ \      \
	L   H ! H                          ! !      !--- Y
	H   L ! H                   B ----/ /      /
	H   H ! L                        / +-------
                                    Figure 4

  The included circuit "XOR.CKT" contains a 74LS86 Quad XOR device.
Both the A and B switches are active high,  therefore the Y LED will
only light when either A or B is on but will not light if both switches
are on or off.

  Many times it is useful to have the opposite function of one of the
base gates (in other words, an inverted output).  These inverted output
gates are called: NAND, NOR, and Exclusive-NOR.  The schematic diagrams
and associated truth tables for these gates are show below:

        XNOR                   NOR                    NAND
      \ +-------               +-------               +-------
 A ----\ \      \         A ----\      \         A ---!       \
        ! !      !O-- Y          !      !O-- Y        !        !O-- Y
 B ----/ /      /         B ----/      /         B ---!       /
      / +-------               +-------               +-------

      A  B ! Y                A  B ! Y                A  B ! Y
      -----+--                -----!--                -----!--
      L  L ! H                L  L ! H                L  L ! H
      L  H ! L                L  H ! L                L  H ! H
      H  L ! L                H  L ! L                H  L ! H
      H  H ! H                H  H ! L                H  H ! L

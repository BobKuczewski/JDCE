SHIFT REGISTERS

  A shift register is a circuit that is capable of taking a binary
number and shifts the bits left or right.  The principle use of shift
registers is to convert data from parallel to serial or from serial
back to parallel.  Nearly all shift registers are built from D-type
flip-flops.  The circuit "FFSHIFT.CKT" demonstrates a shift register
built out of flip-flops.

  The 74LS91 is the most basic of shift registers.  It is an 8-bit
serial-in serial-out register, meaning that data is fed into the
register in serial form and the data is taken out in serial form.  The
principle use of this device is to delay the transmission of data.  The
circuit "74LS91.CKT" demonstrates the operation of this device.  For
each positive clock pulse, data is read into the lowest order bit in
the register.  Eight clock pulses later the bit will appear at the
output.

  Now lets take a look at the 74LS164.  This shift register is an 8-bit
serial-in parallel-out register.  The main use of this register is to
convert a serial transmission into parallel data.  Load the circuit
"74LS164.CKT" and try experimenting with this device.  It is much
easier to see the function of the shift register from this circuit
since you can actually watch the bits being shifted on the LEDs.  The
'164 also has a clear function in order to set all outputs low.  On the
rising edge of each clock pulse the input data is shifted into the
register while all the bits currently in the register are shifted left

  The 74LS165 performs the opposite function of the '164.  The '165
converts parallel data into serial.  The circuit "74LS165.CKT"
demonstrates the function of this device.  Data can be placed onto the
inputs of this device and then when LOAD is pulsed low all 8 bits of
data will be stored into the register.  Now with each positive clock
pulse the bits will be shifted and sent out of the register.  Note that
this device also has a serial input.  On each clock pulse this input is
shifted into the register, just like in the '164.  The main reason why
there is a serial input is to allow cascading of multiple chips in
order to serialize data that is longer than 8 bits.  If you take the
output bit from the lowest order register and feed it into the serial
input of the next higher register you can serialize more than 1 byte at
a time.

  Now lets take a look at the 74178.  This device is a 4 bit
parallel/serial in parallel out shift register.  When both the input
and output of a shift register can be done in parallel then the device
is said to be a parallel access device.  The circuit "74178.CKT"
demonstrates the '178.  Notice that in order for shifting to occur the
SHIFT input must be high.  This device is also negative edge triggered
rather than positive edge as in the previous shift registers we have
looked at.  Notice that just like the other shift registers there is
also a serial input that is used during shift operations.  The load
operation is performed by taking the LOAD input high and then providing
a negative edge clock pulse.

  So far all the shift registers we have looked at could only shift
bits to the left.  The 74LS194 can shift bits both left and right.  The
'194 is also a parallel access device.  When a shift register is
parallel access and can shift in both directions the device is said to
be a universal register.  The '194 is a 4 bit universal register.  The
circuit "74LS194.CKT" demonstrates the functioning of this device.
Notice that this device contains two serial inputs, one is used during
shift operations to the left and the other is used during shift
operations to the right.  The two mode select inputs (S1 and S0) select
which function the '194 will perform on the next rising edge of the
clock.  When the mode is set as L L then the device does not do
anything.  When the mode is set as L H then the device shifts bits to
the left (low order to high order).  when the mode is set as H L then
the device shifts bits from the left to the right.  And when the mode
is set as H H parallel data from inputs A, B, C, and D is loaded into
the register.

  Lets take a quick look at one last shift register.  The 74198 is an 8
bit version of the 74LS194.  The circuit "74198.CKT" demonstrates this
device.  All the inputs and modes work the same on this device as they
did on the '194

  All other shift registers in the 7400 series family operate similarly
to the above registers.  Shift registers in other families of chips
will also operate very closely like the devices in the 7400 family.

QUICK TUTORIAL: In this tutorial we will build a few simple circuits.
First we need to learn about pin numbers so that wires can be properly
connected.  On all chips there is a small dot near pin 1.  When in the
edit mode, this dot appears in the upper left corner of the chip.  In
the run mode, the dot appears in the lower left.  The pin numbers then
move along the same side of the chip.  Pin 2 will be just to the right
of pin 1.  When we get to the end we move to the opposite side of the
chip and start moving leftwards assigning pin numbers.  Below is a
sample chip showing the pin numbers:


      8	 7  6  5
      |	 |  |  |
    +-+--+--+--+-+
    |		 |
    |.		 |
    +-+--+--+--+-+
      |	 |  |  |
      1	 2  3  4

The two display chips (MAN10a, and TIL311) appear vertically on
the screen and the pin 1 will appear in the lower left on these
chips in the edit mode.	 On switches (but not DIP switches) pin 1
is towards the top in the edit mode.  DIP switches are numbered
the same as chips.

  Now lets build a circuit.  Just follow the steps below:

1. Pull down the parts menu and select 'GATES'.

2. Select the 74LS08.

3. The cursor will change to a small picture of chip with
   a small arrow pointing upwards to the left.  This is called the
   placement cursor.  Click on a hole near the middle of the screen
   and a 74LS08 part will appear on the screen.  Look for pin 1,
   re member it is in the upper left corner of the chip and is marked
   with a white dot.
4. Pull down the parts menu and select 'SWITCHES'.

5. Select the 'SWITCH SPDT 2-IN 1-OUT'. This is the sec ond one on
   the list.

6. Place this part about 6 or 7 holes below the 74LS08.
   Take a close look at this part.  Notice in the center there is a
   round pin and above and below there are square ones.  In DCE the
   round switch pin represents the output from the switch and the
   square ones represent inputs.  Also note that there is a line
   connecting the center pin with the square pin on the top.
   This line represents the normal position of the switch (The
   position the switch is in when the circuit is turned on)

7. Get one more of the same switches and place it below
   the 74LS08 and about 5 holes left or right from the first switch.

8. Pull down the parts menu and select 'POWER SUPPLY'.

9. Place the power supply part to the left of the 74LS08.
   Notice that near one pin of the power supply there is a minus (-)
   sign, this represents the ground pin of the circuit.  Next to the
   other pin is a plus (+) sign, this represents the +5v supply.

10. Pull down the parts menu and select 'OUTPUT DEVICES'

11. Select any color of LED. and place it directly above
    the 74LS08 about 6 or 7 holes away.

12. Pull down the WCLR menu.  This menu lets you change
    the colors of wires.  Select black.  We are going to place some
    ground wires, which are typically black.

13. Click on the negative pole of the power supply (the
    one with the minus sign).  A menu will appear. Select 'ADD
    WIRE'. The cursor will now change to a picture of a soldering
    iron.

14. Click on pin 1 of one of the switches (Remember pin 1
    on switches is towards the bottom of the screen.  A black wire
    will be drawn between the power supply and the switch.

15. Now connect pin 1 of the switch above with pin 1 of
    the other switch.

16. Now connect a wire from the negative power supply to
    the cathode of the LED.  The cathode can be identified by a small
    line that appears closer to the top pin.  Therefore the wire
    should be connected to the top pin.

17. Pull down the WCLR menu and select RED.  We are now
    going add some positive power connections which are typically
    red.

18. Place a wire between the positive pole of the power
    supply (the pin with the plus sign) and pin 3 of one of the
    switches. Pin 3 will be the pin towards the top of the screen.
    Remember pin 1 was on the bottom.

19. Connect pin 3 of the switch above with pin 3 of the
    other switch.

20. Pull down the WCLR menu and select BLUE.

21. Connect a wire from pin 2 of one of the switches to pin 1 of
    the 74LS08.  Remember pin 1 of the 74LS08 is marked by a white dot.

22. Connect a wire from pin 2 of the other switch to pin 2
    of the 74LS08.

23. Connect a wire from pin 3 of the 74LS08 to the anode
    of the LED. Remember the cathode was the pin with the line near
    it which appears towards the top of the screen, therefore the anode
    is the pin towards the bottom of the screen.

This circuit is now completed.	Turn the power to the circuit on
by clicking on the RUN button in the upper left corner of the
screen.	 The circuit board will now be flipped right side up.
Both switches will be in the down position and the LED will not
be lit.	 Turn on a switch by clicking on the switch.  The switch
will change to the up position, the LED will still be off.  Now
turn on the other switch and the LED will turn on. In this circuit
the LED will only light when switch 1 AND switch 2 are in the ON
(or up) position.  This circuit is therefore called an AND gate.

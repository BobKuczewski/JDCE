Lets try one more circuit.

1.    Make sure you are starting on a clean board by pressing the
      NEW button in the upper right corner of the screen.

2.    Get a power supply part and place it neat the left side of
      the screen about half way down the screen.

3.    Pull down the parts menu and select miscelaneous chips.
      Select the CLOCK and place it about 5 holes to the right of the
      power supply.

4.    Pull down the parts menu and select counters.  Select the
      74LS161 and place it about 5 holes to the right of the CLOCK.

5.    Pull down the parts menu and select decoders.  Select the
      74LS138 and place it about 5 holes to the right of the 74LS161.

6.    Pull down the parts menu and select OUTPUT DEVICES.  Select
      any color of LED and place it about 5 holes above the 74LS138.

7.    Now get another LED and place it about 2 holes to the right
      of the first LED.

8.    Place 6 more LEDs in a line to the right of the above two
      LEDs in order to make a line of 8 LEDs.

9.    Select red wires from the WCLR menu.

10.   Connect a wire from the positive pole of the power supply
      to the anode of the leftmost LED.  Remember the anode is towards
      the bottom of the screen.

11.   Connect all of the LED anodes together.

12.   Connect a wire from the positive power supply to pin 7 of
      the 74LS161.

13.   Connect a wire from pin 7 of the 74LS161 to pin 10 of the
      74LS161.

14.   Connect a wire from the positive power supply to pin 6 of
      the 74LS138.

15.   Select black wires from the WCLR menu.

16.   Connect a wire from the negative power terminal to pin 4
      of the 74LS138.

17.   Connect a wire between pins 4 and 5 of the 74LS138.

18.   Select blue wires from the WCLR menu.

19.   Connect a wire from pin 8 of the CLOCK to pin 2 of the
      74LS161.

20.   Connect a wire from pin 14 of the 74LS161 to pin 1 of the
      74LS138.

21.   Connect a wire from pin 13 of the 74LS161 to pin 2 of the
      74LS138.

22.   Connect a wire from pin 12 of the 74LS161 to pin 3 of the
      74LS138.

23.   Connect a wire from pin 15 of the 74LS138 to the cathode
      of the rightmost LED.  Remember the cathode is towards the top of
      the screen.

24.   Connect a wire from pin 14 of the 74LS138 to the cathode
      of the LED just to the left of the last one.

25.   Connect a wire from pin 13 of the 74LS138 to the cathode
      of the LED just to the left of the last one.

26.   Connect a wire from pin 12 of the 74LS138 to the cathode
      of the LED just to the left of the last one.

27.   Connect a wire from pin 11 of the 74LS138 to the cathode
      of the LED just to the left of the last one.

28.   Connect a wire from pin 10 of the 74LS138 to the cathode
      of the LED just to the left of the last one.

29.   Connect a wire from pin 9 of the 74LS138 to the cathode of
      the LED just to the left of the last one.

30.   Connect a wire from pin 7 of the 74LS138 to the cathode of
      the LED	 just to the left of the last one.

Now turn on the circuit.  You should see the LEDs lighting in
sequence from the right to the left.  This circuit is an example of
a sequencer.

  Using the above circuit perform these steps:

1.    Click on pin 14 of the 74LS161 and select add probe.
      Type 'A' for the label.

2.    Click on pin 13 of the 74LS161 and select add probe.
      Type 'B' for the label.

3.    Click on pin 12 of the 74LS161 and select add probe.
      Type 'C' for the label.

4.    Click on pin 11 of the 74LS161 and select add probe.
      Type 'D' for the label.

Before running this circuit, turn on the digi-scope by selecting the
SCOPE option in the CIRCUIT menu.  When this circuit is run you will
see the signal traces in the digi-scope screen.

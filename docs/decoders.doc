DEMULTIPLEXERS/DECODERS

  Decoder circuits are capable of taking multiple-bit binary data and
changing into another form for use.  We will in this chapter look at
decoders as well as demultiplexers which are very similar to decoders.

  Lets start our investigation of decoders with the 74LS42.  This
device is a decimal decoder, meaning that it can decode numbers in the
range from 0 to 9.  Load the circuit "74LS42.CKT" which demonstrates
the usage of the '42.  The outputs from this device are active low, so
notice that with the LEDs we connected the outputs to the cathodes
rather than the anodes like in previous circuits.  The '42 will
activate one and only one output based upon the value of the input.
This is said to be a 1 of 10 decoder, meaning the device will activate
one output from ten possible inputs.  Try changing the switches in the
circuit and notice which LED lights.  The number of the lit LED will
correspond with the numbers of the on switches added together.  If a
number greater than 9 is entered the '42 will not have any active
outputs.  One useful application of the '42 is for sequencing.  In
synchronous systems it is important for certain actions to occur at
certain times.  When attached to a counter the '42 provides a sequenced
output that can be used to synchronize other parts of a circuit.  Try
looking at circuit "74LS42-2.CKT" which demonstrates a sequencer.

  The 74LS47 is a very useful device.  This chip takes as its input a 4
bit BCD number and provides outputs to drive 7 segment LED display
corresponding to the number on its inputs.  The circuit "74LS47.CKT"
demonstrates all of the functions of the '47.  The '47 provides a Lamp
Test input that will turn on all of the segments as well as blanking
inputs to turn off all of the segments.  The blanking inputs are used
when you want to remove leading zeroes.  If the RBI is low and the
inputs to the chip represent a zero then the display will be blanked
and a low will be output on the RBO.  This signal can then be fed into
the RBI of the next digit.  This allows for all leading zeroes of a
number to be blanked.  The BI pin (which is also the RBO pin) will
allow you to blank the display regardless of what the inputs are,
remember RBI only blanks the display when the input is also zero.

  Now lets take a look at the 74LS138.  The circuit "74LS138.CKT"
demonstrates the operation of this device.  The '138 is a 1 of 8 or
Octal decoder.  Unlike the '42 this chip has only three inputs, the
required number of inputs to provide 8 possible combinations.  This
device is also gated, meaning that there are control signals that must
be set a certain way in order for the chip to activate an output.
Decoders that are gated are also referred to as demultiplexers.  In the
'138 the G1 input must be high while both G2 inputs must be low.  If
these conditions are not met then all outputs from the device will be
high.  Why are there three gate conditions on this chip?  Well this is
done in order to simplify circuit design.  Suppose you want this chip
to activate when a particular signal is low and another signal is high.
Ordinarily you would have to decode this condition using other chips,
but with the gate scheme used by the '138 this could be done with
direct connections to the chip. Note that the 74LS238 is very similar
to the 74LS138, but with non-inverted outputs (high when selected).

  The 74LS137 is very similar to the '138.  Technically it is pin
compatible with the '138 except one of the gate inputs performs a
different function.  In this device the input bits are latchable.  when
the GL (which was G2a on the '138) input is low then the device
operates exactly like the '138.  When GL goes high the last input value
is stored in an internal latch and the output will continue to show
this latched value regardless of what happens to the inputs until GL
once again goes low.

  The 74LS139 is a dual 2 to 4 decoder, or a 1 of 4 decoder.  Each side
contains two binary inputs, four outputs and an output gate.  Circuit
"74LS139.CKT" demonstrates one side of this device.  This device will
operate similarly to the '138 except for the number of inputs and
outputs and there is only one gate input.

  The 74154 is a 1 of 16 decoder.  This device can fully decode a 4 bit
binary input.  Circuit "74154.CKT" demonstrates this device.  Like all
the decoders above this chip also has active low outputs.  The '154
also has two active low gate enables, therefore in order for the chip
to provide an output, both gate enables must be low.

  Nearly all other decoder/demultiplexers in the 7400 series family
work like the above devices.

FLIP-FLOPS

  There are two states any device can be placed into.  When a stimulus
is placed on an input, the device is said to be in the Active state.
When there is no stimulus on any input, the device is said to be in the
Inactive or rest state.  In all of the gate devices when the stimulus
is removed the output will return to a default value.  For instance, in
the AND gate the output will return Low.  This characteristic is called
"Monostable", meaning the device in its inactive state is stable in
only one output state, like the AND gate returning low.

  Flip-Flops are special circuits that can retain the stimulated output
even when the stimuli are removed.  These devices are considered to be
"Bistable", meaning the output is stable in two states.  If the
stimulated flip-flop outputs a High, the flip-flop will still be
outputting a High when the stimulus is removed.  If the stimulated
flip-flop outputs a Low, then the flip-flop will still be outputting a
low when the stimuli are removed.  There are three basic types of
flip-flops.  They are: S-R type, D-type, and J-K type.  Most all
flip-flop devices have complimentary outputs.  In addition to the main
output (called Q) there is an inverted output (called NOT Q or /Q).
Flip-flops are also considered edge-triggered devices.  The output of a
flip-flop will occur only on a specific edge of an input.  For
instance, if the device is negative-edge triggered, the output will
only be set when the clock input is taken from high to low.  After the
edge transition the output will not change again until another
negative-edge is encountered.

  The flip-flop is one of the most useful circuits available in digital
electronics.  Using flip-flops you can design all kinds of different
circuits including: Counters, Memories, Shift registers, and so on.  In
this and later chapters you will learn many uses for the various types
of flip-flops.

  The most basic flip-flop is the S-R type.  The S-R stands for
Set-Reset.  This flip-flop has two active-low inputs that can either
set the output to a High (Set) or a Low (Reset).  An S-R flip-flop is
made by interconnecting 2 NAND gates.  The S input is connected to one
input of one of the NAND gates while the R input is connected to one
input of the second NAND gate.  Then the outputs of each NAND gate are
connected to the unused input of the other NAND gate.  The output of
the S-NAND gate is used as the Q output and the output of the R-NAND
gate is used as the /Q output.  These flip-flops are most often used to
de-bounce switches.  Mechanical switches when switched can produce 20
or more individual pulses.  If connected to a counter or other
multi-pulse inputting device erroneous results could occur.  An S-R
flip-flop will trigger on the first pulse and all other pulses would be
ignored.  Below is the truth table for a S-R flip-flop:

	S	R	Q	/Q
	H	H	Q°	/Q°
	L	H	H	L
	H	L	L	H
	L	L	H*	H*
	* - Unstable

  There are two differences in this truth table from previous truth
tables we have looked at.  In the first line (where both inputs are
High) we see the symbols Q° and /Q°.  These represent the last state of
the Q and /Q outputs.  In other words if the last state of Q was L then
Q° represents low, if the last state of Q was H then Q° represents
High.  The last line of the table represents the S-R flip-flops
unstable state.  In this state the outputs are not considered stable,
since when either input is brought high again the outputs will change.

  There are two sample S-R flip-flop circuits provided.  They are
called "SRFF-1.CKT" and "SRFF-2.CKT".  "SRFF-1.CKT" contains a 74LS00
NAND gate wired to act as a S-R flip-flop, while "SRFF-2.CKT" uses the
74LS279 QUAD S-R Flip-Flop.  In both circuits the switches are active
low.

  The D-type flip-flop is an improvement upon the S-R type.  In the
D-type flip-flop there are two additional inputs, Clock and Data.  The
S input is renamed to PRESET and the R input is renamed to CLEAR.  Both
PRESET and CLEAR operate the same as in the S-R flip-flop.  The Data
input and Clock input are used together to set the output of the
flip-flop when both CLEAR and PRESET are high.  The D-type flip-flop is
constructed from 3 S-R flip-flops.  Most D-type flip-flops are
positive-edge triggered, meaning the data is transferred from the D
input to the outputs on the rising edge of the clock pulse.  The D-type
flip-flop is useful for memories and shift registers.  Below is the
typical truth table for D-type flip-flops:

	PRE	CLR	CLK	D	Q	/Q
	L	L	X	X	H*	H*
	L	H	X	X	L	H
	H	L	X	X	H	L
	H	H	/	L	L	H
	H	H	/	H	H	L
	H	H	L	X	Q°	/Q°
	H	H	H	X	Q°	/Q°
	* - This state is considered unstable
	° - Previous state of Q and /Q

  This table uses two more new symbols.  The "X" symbol means the
particular input does not matter whether it is High or Low.  The "/"
symbol means on the Positive-Edge.

  The included circuit "DFF-1.CKT" demonstrates a D-type flip-flop
constructed out of S-R flip-flops.  Circuit "DFF-2.CKT" demonstrates
the 74LS74 Dual D-type flip-flop device.  All switches in both circuits
are active high, therefore make sure PRE and CLR are on before using
CLK and D.

  Now lets look at a couple of applications for D-type flip-flops.
Figure 4-2 demonstrates a memory circuit built from a D-type flip-flop.
 In this circuit the input is connected to the Data input of the
flip-flop.  The Q connection then provides the output from the memory
cell.  Data will be stored into the flip-flop when the 'WRITE' input
changes state from low to high.  Nearly all static memory chips store
information using this method.  The included circuit "DFFMEM.CKT" is a
pre-wired circuit demonstrating the memory application for D-type
flip-flops.

  Another useful application for the D-type flip-flop is pulse
detection.  Figure 4-3 shows a basic circuit for asynchronus positive
pulse detection.  Notice the input is connected to the Clock input of
the flip-flop.  The Data input is then tied to ground.  When a positive
pulse is placed onto IN this triggers the flip-flop placing a logic low
on Q and a logic high on /Q.  The /Q will show a high when any positive
pulse is detected on IN.  If /CLR is pulsed low, the output of the
pulse detector will be reset to low.  The included circuit
"PULSE-1.CKT" demonstrates this use for the D flip-flop.

  In the above circuit, any positive pulse at any time will trigger the
output of the circuit.  This ability to detect a pulse at any time is
referred to as Asynchronus.  There are times when you only want to
detect the pulse at a given time.  To detect a pulse at a given time
you must use a Synchronous pulse detector.  Figure 4-4 shows a circuit
for a Synchronous positive pulse detector.  This circuit will only
sample the input on the positive edge of CLOCK.  In this circuit the
input line (IN) is connected to the D input of the flip-flop.  The
active-high pulse detection is then output on Q.  The synchronous clock
source is then connected to the C input.  Lets take a close look at how
this circuit works.  If  the input is low when CLOCK is pulsed then Q
(OUT) will be set low and /Q will be set high.  The high value on /Q is
fed back into /S, which according to the truth table for D flip-flops
will have no effect.  In essence if the input was low when CLOCK is
pulsed, then the output of the circuit will remain low.  Now if a high
is placed on IN when CLOCK is pulsed Q will become high while /Q will
become low.  OUT is now showing the fact that a positive pulse was
detected.  The low being output from /Q is then fed back into /S which
according to the truth table will set Q high (which it already is), and
/Q to low (which also already is).  This feedback will force the
flip-flop to continue to output a high regardless of the states of IN
or CLOCK.  In fact the only way to reset Q to low is to pulse CLR low.
Remember when both /S and /R are low the outputs of Q and /Q will be
high, which removes the feedback signal on /S and allows the circuit to
once again output a low when CLR goes back high.

  Pulse detection is a very useful capability and in later lessons we
will be revisiting pulse detection and why it is so useful.  Remember
in the Asynchronus detector, any positive pulse can be detected at any
time, while in the Synchronous detector, the pulse is only sampled at a
set time.  By very slight modification of these two detectors you can
detect negative pulses.  Try modifying these basic circuits to produce
negative pulse detectors.

  The J-K type is the most advanced flip-flop.  Instead of a single
data input (D) there are two, J and K.  Depending on the states of J
and K when the flip-flop is triggered depends on what happens at the
outputs.  J-K flip-flops come in two main types: Master-Slave and
negative-edge triggered.  In the Master-Slave type the data from J and
K are transferred to a master circuit on the positive-edge of the clock
pulse and transferred to the slave (outputs) on the negative edge,
while the negative-edge triggered type transfers the data from the J
and K inputs directly to the outputs on the negative-edge of the clock
pulse.  The J-K type flip-flop is particularly useful in making
counters.  Below is a typical truth table for a J-K Master-Slave
flip-flop:

	PRE	CLR	CLK	J	K	Q	/Q
	L	L	X	X	X	H*	H*
	L	H	X	X	X	H	L
	H	L	X	X	X	L	H
	H	H	L	X	X	Q°	/Q°
	H	H	/\	L	L	Q°	/Q°
	H	H	/\	L	H	H	L
	H	H	/\	H	L	L	H
	H	H	/\	H	H	/Q°	Q°
	* - This state is considered unstable
	° - The previous state of Q and /Q

  Note the new symbol used in this table "/\".  This symbol represents
a single clock pulse from the positive-edge to the negative-edge.  Also
look at what happens to the outputs in the last line of the table.
When both the J and K inputs are high the outputs toggle rather than
follow the data.  The truth table for a negative-edge triggered J-K
flip flop is virtually identical to the Master-Slave table except the
symbol "\" is used in place of the "/\" symbol.  The "\" symbol
represents the negative-edge of the clock pulse.

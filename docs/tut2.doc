Now try wiring this circuit:

1. Make sure you have a clean perfboard by clicking on the NEW
   button in the upper right corner of the screen.

2. Pull down the parts menu and select 'COUNTERS'.

3. Select a 74LS68 and place it on the perfboard about the
   middle of the screen.

4. Pull down the parts menu and select 'POWER SUPPLY' and
   place it to the left of the 74LS68.

5. Pull down the parts menu and select 'SWITCHES'. Select the
   'BUTTON SPDT 2-IN 1-OUT' and place it below the 74LS68 about 6 or
   7 holes.

6. Pull down the parts menu and select 'LABEL'. When asked
   for the label type 'CLR' and press enter. You will now get the
   placement cursor click on the hole below the switch to place the
   label.

7. Place another button (same type) about 5 holes to the right
   of the first button.

8. Pull down the parts menu and select 'LABEL'. Use CLK for
   the label. place it on the whole beneath the second switch.

9. Pull down the parts menu and select 'OUTPUT DEVICES'. Select
   the 'TIL311' and place it above the 74LS68 about 6 or 7 holes.

10. Pull down the 'WCLR' menu and select 'BLACK'. Once again
    we are going to place some ground lines.

11. Place a wire between the negative pole of the power supply
    and pin 3 of the switch marked 'CLR'. Remember pin 3 is towards
    the top of the screen.

12. Place a wire between pin 3 of switch 'CLR' and pin 1 of
    switch 'CLK. Remember pin 1 is towards the bottom.

13. Place a wire between the negative power terminal and pin 5
    of the TIL311.	Pin 5 is on the left side 5 pins from the bottom
    of the device.	Remember pin 1 is marked by the dot which is in
    the lower left on this chip.

14. Place a wire between pin 5 of the TIL311 and pin 8 of the
    TIL311.	 Pin 8 is on the upper right.

15. Pull down the WCLR menu and select 'RED' wires.

16. Place a wire between the positive power terminal and pin 1
    of the switch 'CLR'.

17. Place a wire between pin 1 of switch 'CLR' and pin 3 of
    switch 'CLK'.

18. Pull down the WCLR menu and select 'BLUE' wires.

19. Place a wire between pin 2 of switch 'CLR' (thats the middle pin)
    and pin 11 of the 74LS68. Pin 11 is the third pin from the right
    on the bottom side of the chip.

20. Place a wire between pin 2 of switch 'CLK' and pin 9 of
    the 74LS68. Pin 9 is on the lower right corner of the chip.

21. Pull down the WCLR menu and select gray wires.

22. Place a wire between pin 7 of the 74LS68 and pin 3 of the TIL311.

23. Place a wire between pin 10 of the 74LS68 and pin 2 of the TIL311.

24. Place a wire between pin 5 of the 74LS68 and pin 13 of the TIL311.

25. Place a wire between pin 12 of the 74LS68 and pin 12 of the TIL311.

Our circuit is now ready to start.  Click on the RUN button in
the upper left corner of the screen.  Click on the CLR button to
reset the output display back to zero.	Buttons will remain
pressed as long as the mouse cursor remains on them and the mouse
button is held down.  Now repeatedly press the CLK button and notice
what happens on the display.  This circuit is called a counter
circuit.  Keep pressing CLK and notice where the counter resets
back to zero.  This counter is an example of a Decade or BCD counter.
Try rebuilding this circuit and substitute a 74LS69 in place of the
74LS68. The 74LS69 is a Binary counter and actually counts all the
way to 15 before resetting back to zero.  Notice also that above 9
letters are shown.  these letters are part of the hexadecimal
numbering system.

Electricity

  In most metals the electrons are loosely bound to their atoms and can
easily be moved from atom to atom.  When an electron is pushed into an
atom, another electron will be released which then can be pushed into
another atom and so forth.  This free movement activity is called
electricity.  A conductor is any material that allows this free
movement of electrons, while an insulator is any material that prevents
the free movement of electrons.  Most all metals are conductive,
although some are more conductive than others.  Copper is one of the
most conductive metals and therefore is used the most in wires.

  Electrons are negatively charged particles.  An atom having more
electrons than protons will be negatively charged, this is often called
a negative ion.  An atom having fewer electrons than protons is
positively charged and is called a positive ion.  When two particles
have opposite charges they are attracted to each other, while if the
charges are the same the particles will repel each other.  This
opposite-attracting force is fundamental to all use of electricity.  In
an electric circuit there are two poles, The positive pole which
contains mostly positive ions, and the negative pole containing mostly
negative ions.  Like all things in nature a balance is sought between
the two poles.  The negative pole containing an abundance of electrons
(high pressure) will flow towards the positive pole (low pressure) in
order to equalize.

  There are three forces at work in all electric circuits. Voltage,
Amperage, and Resistance.  Voltage is the force that causes the
electrons to flow towards the positive pole.  The greater the pressure
differential between the poles, the more the electrons will want to
flow, and therefore the more voltage.  This can be likened to two water
tanks, one full of water on top of a hill and the other empty at the
bottom of the hill with a pipe between them.  The water in the top tank
wants to run downhill and fill the bottom tank.  The higher the top
tank is above the lower tank increases the pressure for the water to
flow to the lower tank.

  Amperage refers to the number of electrons that are actually flowing.
Using our water example,  amperage would refer to how much water is
actually flowing through the pipe.  If the pressure is increased, more
water will flow through the pipe, this is the same with electrons, if
the voltage is increased, more electrons will flow through the wire,
therefore voltage has a direct influence on amperage.

  Resistance is the force in the electronic components that resist the
flow of electrons.  If there is little or no resistance between the
poles the circuit is said to be "Short", which is potentially damaging
to the power source.  Again using our water example, if we reduce the
size of the pipe less water can flow through it, less current, and
therefore less amperage.  Resistance therefore has a direct
relationship with amperage.

  Ohms law specifies the relationship between Voltage (E), Amperage (I),
and resistance (R).  The formula for Ohms law is E=IR.  Using this
formula, if you know two of the forces you can compute the third.  If
you know the current and the resistance you can compute the voltage
using this formula.  If you know the voltage and the resistance you can
compute the current with the formula I=E/R and if you know the voltage
and the current you can compute the resistance with the formula R=E/I.

  There are two basic ways of producing electricity.  The first way is
chemically.  Certain chemicals will react with certain metals producing
either an abundance of electrons or an abundance of holes.  One such
example is the lemon battery.  Using an ordinary lemon, a piece of
copper, and a piece of zinc, you can make a simple battery.  The zinc
will react with the citric acid in the lemon and produce an abundance
of electrons.  The copper will react with the citric acid and produce
an abundance of holes.  This allows a voltage potential to develop
between the zinc and copper plates.  All batteries are based upon a
similar principle, the creation of electricity by chemical interaction
with certain metals.

  The second way of producing electricity is magnetically.  The
theories of electricity and magnetism are very closely tied together.
When electrons are flowing along a wire a moving magnetic field is
created around the wire.  Electro-magnets are based upon this
principle.  The coil of wire in the electro-magnet allows for strong
magnetic fields to be generated when electricity is passed through the
wire.  We can also apply these forces in reverse.  If we take a magnet
and move it along wire we can induce voltage onto the wire.  The moving
magnetic field will cause electrons to flow in the direction of the
moving magnetic field.  A generator is nothing more than a large amount
of coiled wire with a strong moving magnet rotating on the inside.

  Now that we know what electricity is and how it works lets look into
"electronics."  Electronic components are designed to alter the flow of
electricity in a circuit.  It is this alteration of the electric flow
that allows us to perform useful functions with electricity.  We will
look at resisters, capacitors, inductors, diodes, and transistors.

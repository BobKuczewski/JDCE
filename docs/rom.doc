EPROMS:
There are four standard EPROMS provided with DCE.  These are
2708, 2716, 2732, and 2764.  The programming characteristics of
these devices is not emulated, only the read capability.  You can
provide programming for EPROMs using .rom files.

When you place an EPROM into a circuit you will be asked for the
.rom file that contains the image for the rom.

The .rom file is a straight ASCII file containing hex data
describing the image for the rom.  Two types of data can be entered
into this file: Hex data to be placed into the rom and hex address
data to set the write pointer.  Hex data consists of two characters
of hex data that will be written to the current write pointer in the
rom.  A Hex address is preceeded by a colon (:), this resets the
current write pointer for following data.  It is not necessary to
load the rom in sequential order, you can in fact jump all over the
address space in any order you choose.

Below is a sample .rom file:

    00 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 08 09 0A 0B 0C 0D 0E 0F
    :1000
    FF FF FF FF
    :0200
    0A 0A 0A 0A

This file would set the first 16 addresses to the numbers 00-0F,
then four FF's are stored starting at address 1000h, and then 4
0A's are stored starting at address 200h.

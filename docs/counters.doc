COUNTERS

  Counters are circuits that count clock pulses.  Most counters in the
7400 series family are 4-bit counters and are of two types: Binary and
decade (or BCD).  The majority of counters are constructed from J-K
Type flip-flops.  The included circuit "JKCOUNT.CKT" demonstrates a
counter built out of J-K flip-flops.

  Load the circuit called "74LS68.CKT".  This circuit utilizes a binary
counter connected to an led hex digit display.  Press the CLR button
and then start pressing the CLK button.  Keep counting and notice when
the counter resets back to zero.  This chip is known as a BCD or Decade
counter because the count is limited from 0 to 9.  Now load
"74LS69.CKT" and notice how this counter differs from the last one.
This counter counts all the way through F before resetting back to
zero.  This is known as a Binary counter.

  The 74LS68 and 74LS69 counters are said to be pin compatible, meaning
that the wiring connections are identical.  One chip can be replaced
with the other in the same circuit, the only difference is in how far
each counter counts.  Many of the counters in the 7400 series have
Decade and Binary pin compatible equivalents.

  Lets take a closer look at the 74LS68 and '69.  These chips are
actually dual counter chips, meaning there are two 4 bit counters on
each chip.  Call up the data sheet on one of these chips.  The second
counter on these chips contains a full 4-bit counter with a clear
input. while the first counter is separated into two parts.  Notice the
first counter has two clock signals.  The first clock signal controls
only Qa.  The second clock signal then controls Qb, Qc, and Qd.  In
order to get the full count available on counter 1 you must connect Qa
to the second clock input.  Why would they do this you might be asking.
 Well the first counter can be used in three different ways.  First by
using only the second clock you now have a counter that counts half of
the full potential of the chip.  In the '68 the count will count to 4
and then reset and the '69 will count to 7 before resetting.  This
gives you other counts in case the usual decade and binary counts are
not adequate.  In the second use, you tie the Qa output to the second
clock and provide the full count just like in the second counter.  In
the third usage you can tie the Qd input to the first clock, and now Qa
will represent a clock pulse that is a multiple of the input clock. for
instance, in the '68 if we tie Qd to the first clock, it now takes 5
clock pulses before Qa will go high, then it will take another 5 clock
pulses for Qa to go low, therefore Qa now represents a new clock that
is 10 times slower than the input clock.  You are not restricted to
attaching Qd to the first clock, you could in fact use any of the
outputs to trigger the first clock, each of which will give you a
different output clock.  Load circuit "74LS68S.CKT".  run this circuit
using the digi-scope mode, and notice the output clock in relation to
the input clock.

  Now lets look at the 74LS160 counter.  Load "74LS160.CKT".  This chip
contains a single 4 bit Decade counter.  There are three main
differences between this counter and the previous counters.  First this
counter has only a single clock input, and more importantly this
counter is presettable.  The starting count can be set in this counter
by taking the LOAD input low.  Try experimenting with this circuit.
This counter has another useful feature, a ripple carry output.  This
output when connected to the CLOCK input of another counter allows us
to count using multiple digits.  Notice that the RCO led turns on when
the counter is on the last count (in this case 9) and then goes low
again when the counter rolls over to zero.  This counter's clock input
triggers on the negative edge, therefore when RCO goes low again, the
clock input of another counter will be stimulated at the proper time.

  Like the 74LS68, this counter also has a Binary equivalent.  The
74LS161 counter is pin compatible with the '160, but counts all the way
through F.  Load the circuit "74LS161.CKT" and try experimenting with
this circuit.  Notice all the same capabilities as the '160 are also in
the '161, only the terminal count is different.

  There is another counter that is pin compatible with the '160, this
is the 74LS162.  This chip is also a decade counter, but with one very
important difference.  The CLEAR input to this chip is synchronous with
the clock.  In the '160 and '161 whenever the CLEAR input was brought
low, the counter immediately cleared to zero.  In the '162 after the
CLEAR is pulsed low the counter will continue to hold the last count
until a clock pulse occurs.  Load the circuit "74LS162.CKT" and
experiment with this feature.  Set the count to some value other than
zero and then press the CLEAR button.  Notice that the counter did not
reset to zero.  Now press the CLOCK button, now the counter resets.
This type of clear function is called Synchronous Clear.  The 74LS163
is the Binary version of the '162.  The circuit "74LS163.CKT"
demonstrates the use of the '163.

  Now lets take a look at the 74LS190 counter.  This Decade counter is
not only presettable but also can count down as well as up.  The
circuit "74LS190.CKT" demonstrates this counter.  Try providing clock
pulses while the switch is in the UP position and note that the counter
counts upwards.  Change the switch to the down position and note that
the counter counts downwards.  Two outputs are provided for cascading
other counters.  The RCO is an active low carry/borrow output, while
the MAX/MIN is active high carry/borrow output.  When the counter is
about to wrap around these two outputs become active.  Notice also with
this counter that the count changes on the positive edge of the clock.
Remember the counters we looked at previously triggered on the negative
edge.  The 74LS191 counter is the pin compatible binary version of the
'190.  The circuit "74LS191.CKT" demonstrates the '191 counter.

  Now lets look at the 74LS192.  The '192 is also an Up Down counter.
The main difference between this counter and the '190 is that this
counter has separate clocks for the up and down counts as well as
separate carry and borrow outputs.  The circuit "74LS192.CKT"
demonstrates the usage of this chip.  This chip like the last two also
are triggered on the positive edge of the clock.  The 74LS193 is the
pin campatable Binary equivalent.  The circuit "74LS193.CKT"
demonstrates the '193.

  There are also two other characteristics found in counters, and this
has to do with the output switching of the device.  The two output
types are Ripple, and Synchronous.  In ripple counters one flip-flop is
used to clock the next one.  These counters typically have lower
propagation delays but they very briefly present an invalid count at
their outputs.  This invalid output occurs during the propagation delay
of the device.  For instance when the ripple counter counts from 1 to
2, during the propagation delay a 3 will appear on the outputs for a
brief moment.  For synchronized systems this is not generally
considered a problem, whereas in asynchronus circuits this can produce
invalid results.

  Synchronous counters clock the output flip-flops all at the same time
which prevents the invalid counts during the propagation delay.  The
drawback to synchronous counters is that they usually have longer
propagation delays and therefore may not be suitable in high speed
circuits.

  Due to the way DCE controls timing, ripple counters will not exhibit
the characteristics described above.  All counters used in DCE will
appear as synchronous counters to other chips in the circuit.

THE TRANSISTOR

  The transistor is similar to the diode, except instead of only one PN
junction there are two.  The transistor is basicly an electrically
operated switch.  There are two main types of transistors, the NPN and
the PNP.  The NPN transistor is made from one piece of P-material
sandwiched between two pieces of N-material while the PNP transistor is
made from one piece of N-material sandwiched between two pieces of
P-material.  Our discussion here of transistors will demonstrate the
operation of a typical NPN transistor.  A PNP transistor works the same
way but the charges are reversed.

  Figure 1 shows the basic construction of the NPN transistor.  It
is vary much like two diodes attached together sharing one P-material.
There are three wires on the transistor which are called the Collector
(C), the Base (B), and the Emitter (E).  When voltage is applied to the
base, current can flow from the Emitter to the Collector.

  Figure 2 shows what happens in the transistor when voltage is
applied to the emitter and the collector but no voltage is applied to
the base.  Like in the diode the electrons flowing in the emitter
(N-material) will produce an abundance of electrons.  The holes in the
base material (P-material) are mutually attracted to the electrons in
the emitter, but since no voltage is applied to the base, the threshold
voltage will not be exceeded.  Meanwhile in the collector the electrons
are drawn to the positive charge being applied and like the diode when
inverse voltage is applied a zone of non-conductance is created at the
boundary of the collector and the base.  This prevents any voltage from
passing through the transistor.

           !----       !       ++++!-----------!
           +-----------+-----------+-----------+

                             !
               Figure 2


  Now lets look at what happens when a voltage is applied to the base.
Notice in Figure 3 that the base-emitter junction resembles what
happens in the diode when the voltage is forward.  This allows current
to flow from the emitter to the base just like current flowed in the
diode.  Now when there is a positive charge on the collector there is
an added voltage potential pulling on the electrons.  This will produce
an abundance of electrons in the base material as well as the emitter
material (see Figure 4).  Now just as the electrons in the collector
material were drawn to the positive charge, the electrons in the base
material will also be drawn to the positive charge.

  The PNP transistor works in a very similar fashion except the charges
are reversed.  A positive charge is applied to the emitter and a
negative charge is applied to the base to allow conductivity.
